# üñ•Ô∏è Operating System Simulation Project

A simplified simulation of core Operating System functionalities, designed to demonstrate how modern OS components interact with hardware, manage processes, and execute tasks efficiently.

---

## üì¶ Features Implemented

1. **Hardware Resources**  
   Simulated CPU cores and memory blocks for resource management and allocation.

2. **Operating System Boot**  
   Initializes hardware abstraction, sets up process tables, and loads system modules.

3. **Instruction Guide**  
   A CLI-based user guide to help users interact with and test various OS features.

4. **Task Execution**  
   Tasks are executed using `execlp`, enabling isolated child processes to simulate real-world execution.

5. **Process Scheduling**  
   A dynamic scheduler backed by a circular queue structure that ensures fair and efficient process execution.

6. **Process Lifecycle**  
   Complete management of process creation, execution, waiting, and termination, with proper resource cleanup.

7. **Data Storage**  
   Simulated file and block-based storage for temporary data generated by processes.

8. **Handling Interrupts**  
   Installed `SIGCHLD` handlers to detect child process terminations and trigger resource deallocation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Uncontrolled Task Execution**  
   Tasks failed to run in sequence.  
   ‚úÖ *Fixed using `execlp` in child processes along with the `--wait` flag to ensure sequential execution.*

2. **Inefficient Process Queuing**  
   Resource limitations blocked new processes.  
   ‚úÖ *Solved with a circular queue and retry logic in the scheduler when resources become available.*

3. **Resource Leakage on Process Termination**  
   Memory/CPU remained locked after task exit.  
   ‚úÖ *Resolved by handling `SIGCHLD`, deallocating resources, and removing stale process table entries.*

## üìö Learnings from the Project

- Deep understanding of **process lifecycle** from creation to termination.
- How OS manages **hardware resources**, including CPU time and memory.
- The critical role of **context switching** for smooth multitasking.
- Why and how **resource leaks** affect system stability, and ways to prevent them.
- Implemented real-world OS concepts like **interrupt handling**, **child processes**, and **dynamic scheduling**.
